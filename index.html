        <p>Hello! My name is Lisa, and I’m from Utah. I’m a proud wife and mother — my husband
            and I have been married for nearly 16 years, and we have two wonderful children:
            a 14-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter. I’ve spent the past 17 years working in the financial
            industry,
            and I’m now excited to be pursuing a degree in software development.
            I have a passion for problem-solving and love the challenge of creating new and innovative solutions. </p>
